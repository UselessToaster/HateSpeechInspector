# HateSpeechInspector
This program is an extension for google chrome that receives your text, analyzes them and submits comments according to the Google Cloud NaturalLanguage API.
To set-up the extension:
1) Download the Samura folder off of github 
2) go to chrome://extensions ("manage extensions in the dropdown)
3) toggle developer mode all the way to the right 
4) then select "load unpacked"
5) then select the folder you just downloaded and the extension will run in your browser (like a regular extension)
6) Since notification input was not setup, it can be manually sent through the provided python script, run the "python-api-html.py" and enter the text
7) The analyzed comments will now be visible in the extension(click on it)
